# Defect-Phase-prediction
Defect data visualization and defect phase detection.

Data of defects is fetched from ALM using macros and then some visualizations done to get different insights from data and then predictions is done on defect detection phase column in order to check whether the model is predicting any Production defects or not based on historical conditions.
If the model is predicting any defect in Production phase then we need to cross verify the application again before deploying it to producton environment.
